## A Predictive Analysis of a Shopping Website Data

The dataset contains several columns one of which is the Revenue column which is the categorical columns and used as the output y. It has only 2 variables which are True and False. True indicates that there was revenue, in other words, the visitor made a purchase, False indicates there was no revenue, meaning the visitor didn't make a purchase.

Three different notebooks are created for this project, with each containing, discriptive analysis of the data to understand the relationship between the features which also helps in feature selection for modelling. 

Another notobook contains the clustering analysis and the third notebook has the machine learning algorithms used in training and evaluation of the model. The algoithm used eventually was the RandomForest algorithm, as it gives a very good score and minimum error.

So, I am able to predict if a particular visitor of the web page will buy a product or not.
